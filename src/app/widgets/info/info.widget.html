    <h3>Welcome to the Wolfpack RPG!</h3>
    <span>
      The Wolfpack RPG is a text-based RPG run by LobotJr on the LobosJr Twitch
      channel. The game is played by whispering commands to LobotJr, or by using
      this controller page to interact with the bot directly.
      <br /><br />
      You earn experience and Wolfcoins by watching the stream. Once you hit
      level 3, you will be allowed to select a class and begin running dungeons.
      LobotJr will whisper you when you reach this point with instructions to
      select a class.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once you have selected a class, you can begin running dungeons. You can
      either form a group with other chat members, or use the group finder to be
      automatically placed in the dungeon queue. When you complete a dungeon,
      you will earn additional experience and Wolfcoins, and there is a chance
      you can earn an item or pet as well.
